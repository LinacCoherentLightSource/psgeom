Hi TJ,

Here's the trick, the stuff we've been using for metrology isn't well documented because we're trying to change it to something more standard.  I'd prefer you document and use that, even though it's still experimental.

Here's the documentation:
http://cci.lbl.gov/publications/download/CCN_2014_p19.pdf

Look for the article "XFEL detectors and ImageCIF"

Now, we have some code that converts between the LCLS optical metrology format and back.  First, source the psdm environment and the cctbx sources (assuming bash):

. /reg/g/psdm/etc/ana_env.sh
. /reg/g/cctbx/build/setpaths.sh

Now, assuming you have a 0-end.data file from your experiment's calibration directory, you can use this command to make a cbf header:

cxi.slaccalib2cbfheader 0-end.data out=header.cbf

You can use cxi.display_metrology on either file to see a plot of the results.

Then, to go in the other direction, perhaps after some refinement:

cxi.cbfheader2slaccalib cbf_header=header.cbf out_metrology_file=0-end.new.data

Verify the round trip worked:

diff 0-end.data 0-end.new.data

I can provide more details as needed.
